# 🎤 Transcribe Audio to Text Using AI (For Free!)

Welcome to this simple and powerful tool that helps you turn audio files into text. This tool is perfect if you want to convert things like podcasts, interviews, or any recorded audio into readable text.

## 📋 What You Need Before You Start

1. **A Mac computer**: This tool is designed to work on Mac computers.
2. **An audio file**: The tool works best with MP3 files.

## 🛠️ How to Set It Up (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Download the Project

First, you need to get the project files onto your computer:

1. Click the green `Code` button on this page.
2. Select `Download ZIP` to get all the files in a compressed folder.
3. After downloading, find the ZIP file in your Downloads folder and double-click it to unzip it.

### 2. Install the Tool

Once you have the files on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Finder** (the smiley face icon in your Dock).
2. Go to the folder where you unzipped the files (it might be called `Transcribe-audio-to-text-using-AI-free`).
3. Inside that folder, find the file named **`setup.command`**.
4. Double-click **`setup.command`**.

This will open a terminal window (a black box where you can type commands) and install everything the tool needs to run. Wait a few minutes while it sets up. When it’s done, the window will close by itself.

### 3. Use the Tool to Transcribe Audio

Now that the tool is installed, you can start turning audio files into text:

1. Go back to the folder where you unzipped the files.
2. Open the **`transcriptiontool`** folder.
3. Double-click the **`run_transcribe.command`** file.

This will open the terminal again and ask you to type the name of the audio file you want to transcribe. Here’s how to do it:

1. Make sure the audio file (like `my_audio.mp3`) is in the same folder as the `run_transcribe.command` file.
2. In the terminal, type the exact name of the file (for example, `my_audio.mp3`) and press **Enter**.
3. The tool will start working to turn the audio into text. This might take a few minutes, so be patient!

When it’s done, it will save the text in a file with the same name as your audio file, but with `.txt` at the end (for example, `my_audio.txt`).

## 🚀 What’s Inside the Project?

Here’s a quick overview of the important files and folders:

- **`transcriptiontool`**: This folder has the main tool files.
  - **`Transcribe.py`**: The brain of the tool, where all the magic happens.
  - **`run_transcribe.command`**: The file you double-click to use the tool.
- **`setup.command`**: The file you double-click to install the tool.
- **`README.md`**: This guide you’re reading now!

## 💡 Tips and Troubleshooting

- **Make sure your audio file is in the same folder as `run_transcribe.command`**. Otherwise, the tool won’t be able to find it!
- **If something goes wrong** and you see a lot of text in the terminal that you don’t understand, don’t worry! Close the terminal and try running `setup.command` again.
